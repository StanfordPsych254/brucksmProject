##Introduction

Schaerer et al.'s goal of Experiment 1a was to provide preliminary evidence that having an alternative is not always optimal in a negotiation. While previous research argued that having alternatives provided power to the negotiator because they are not completely dependent on the current negotiation, the study aimed to demonstrate that weak alternatives actually lead to worse outcomes than having no alterantive offer at all. The mechanism at play is an anchoring effect. The alternatives anchor the negotiator's first offer. Having a weak alternative causes a negotatior to start too low on the first offer, leading to a worse outcome relative to having a storng attractive alternative, and more importantly, relative to having no alternative at all. 

The target finding of the replication was to find that participants with a weak alternative will make lower first offers than participants with either a strong alternative or no alternative at all in a hypothetical negotiation. In addition, a secondary finding was that the participants with no alternative will still feel the least powerful of all three conditions. 

##Methods

###Power Analysis
 To fill out later

###Planned Sample
	The planned sample size will be based on the power analysis. There were no preselections as there were none in the original study.

###Materials
	We contacted the authors and got the survey materials with exact wording. 
  
####Manipulation 
Participants will be randomly assigned to a no alternative, strong alternative, or weak alternative condition.

This is what the article says about what the hypothetical negotiation looked like: 
    "Participants were told to imagine that they had recently purchased a digital music player and therefore wanted to       sell one of their old CDs. They were also given information about the quality of the CD (used but in reasonably good condition, with no scratches and an intact case). Then, they were informed that a potential buyer asked them for an initial offer. In the no-BATNA condition, participants were told: 'Nobody else has offered you money for the CD. Thus, if you can’t reach an agreement in the current negotiation, you won’t get any money for the CD.' In the weak-BATNA condition, par- ticipants read: 'Another buyer has offered you $2 for the CD. Thus, if you can’t reach an agreement in the current negotiation, you will get $2 for the CD.' Instructions were identical in the strong-BATNA condition, but the alterna- tive offer was $8 instead of $2."

####DVs
  "Immediately after the BATNA manipulation, participants were instructed to make the first offer, which was our key dependent measure. Then, the negotiation was terminated, and participants were asked to indicate the extent to which they felt powerful (1 = powerless, 7 = powerful), in control (1 = no control, 7 = in control), strong (1 = weak, 7 = strong), and confident (1 = unconfident, 7 = confident). Responses to these four items were averaged to create a single measure of perceived power. Finally, participants completed an attention check and provided demographic information."
  
(NOTE: I will replace with exact wording once I contact the authors. Specifically, I need the set up before the crucial manipulation and how they requested the first offer. I will also ask about the attention check, but that might need to change depending on the mturker's experience with that attention check.)

###Procedure
	The procedure was the same as when the authors ran the study on Mturk: Participants first read the manipulation (a hypothetical negotiation situation), and then they answered the dependent variable questions in the same order as the original paper.

##Analysis Plan

####Data Cleaning Rules
  As the original authors did, we excluded participants that had a duplicate IP address, incorrectly answered the attention check, and who made first offers with extreme values (> 3 SD from the mean). For the original paper, this amounted to 17/305, or ~6%.
  
####Analyses
  For the first offers, we used dummy coding and regression to compare the mean first offer of the no alteranative condition to the other two conditions. We also used different dummy codes to compare the strong alterantive to the no alterantive condition.
  For the perceived power, we aggreated the four items to create a single measure, as the original paper did, and then used regression and dummy coding to compare the no alternative condition to the other to conditions as well as the weak condition relative to the strong condition.
  In addition, to match the exact anlsyes of the authors, we also calcualted effect sizes and reported confidence intervals for the means of the different conditions. 

####Differences from Original Study
Fortunately, we did not antcipate differences between this replciation and the original paper. Both studies will be run on MTurk with a similar demogrpahic and the materials will be identical to the original study. The attention check might need to be different, depending on if it is one that MTurkers have habituated to.
